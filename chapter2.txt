After the School Shutdowns, you were either celebrating or dealing with heartbreak. My parents were in the
latter group. But when the only remaining school in my district was designated for special case students,
their heartbreak became anger, and they put up a fight. This was all before I was born, they told me, and
their parent coalition had halted construction (well, more like destruction) of two elemntary schools and 
one high school for a week. But other parents in their pact grew tired of sleepless nights in front of 
schoolbuildings, and some even switched allegiances, persuading others that students would learn better 
from home and this transition would boost the economy. My parents couldn't be mollified - at least, that's 
how I heard it. But if this were true, then they were still fighting a losing battle. And it was more for 
themselves than for me, I felt. I never missed what I never had.
